# Notuno (WIP)

## What is this?

Notuno is a card game. Or, a card engine. Hmm, not sure. But it's definitely not an other famous card game.

More seriously, we wanted to have a card game engine where card is a mod. We don't know what type of game we'll be able to implement using this framework, but we at least want to have a uno-like game.

In `core` you can find the actual core, mod-loader, and game mechanics. `mods` contains some mods we've made yet, and game models. In the future we'll add a gui, but we want to keep the core as independent as possible.
